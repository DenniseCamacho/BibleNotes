        "and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness,\n

        the righteousness which is from God by faith."

    <string name="philippians3_1">1 Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. For me to write the same things to you is not tedious, but for you it is safe.</string>
    <string name="philippians3_2">2 Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the mutilation!</string>
    <string name="philippians3_3">3 For we are the circumcision, who worship God in the Spirit, rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh,</string>
    <string name="philippians3_4">4 though I also might have confidence in the flesh.</string>
    <string name="philippians3_5">5 Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews; concerning the law, a Pharisee;</string>
    <string name="philippians3_6">6 concerning zeal, persecuting the church; concerning the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.</string>
    <string name="philippians3_7">7 But what things were gain to me, these I have counted loss for Christ.</string>
    <string name="philippians3_8">8 Yet indeed I also count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as rubbish, that I may gain Christ.</string>
    <string name="philippians3_9">9 and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness, which is from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith.</string>
    <string name="philippians3_10">10 That I may know Him and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death.</string>
    <string name="philippians3_11">11 If, by any means, I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.</string>
    <string name="philippians3_12">12 Not that I have already attained, or am already perfected; but I press on, that I may lay hold of that for which Christ Jesus has also laid hold of me.</string>
    <string name="philippians3_13">13 Brethren, I do not count myself to have apprehended; but one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forward to those things which are ahead.</string>
    <string name="philippians3_14">14 I press toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.</string>
    <string name="philippians3_15">15 Therefore let us, as many as are mature, have this mind; and if in anything you think otherwise, God will reveal even this to you.</string>
    <string name="philippians3_16">16 Nevertheless, to the degree that we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us be of the same mind.</string>
    <string name="philippians3_17">17 Brethren, join in following my example, and note those who so walk, as you have us for a pattern.</string>
    <string name="philippians3_18">18 For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ.</string>
    <string name="philippians3_19">19 Whose end is destruction, whose god is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame—who set their mind on earthly things.</string>
    <string name="philippians3_20">20 For our citizenship is in heaven, from which we also eagerly wait for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.</string>
    <string name="philippians3_21">21 Who will transform our lowly body that it may be conformed to His glorious body, according to the working by which He is able even to subdue all things to Himself.</string>
